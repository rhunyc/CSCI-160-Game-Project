# CSCI 160 Game Project
 This is the predecessor to Half-Life Escape, that I developed for my first Computer Science course

This was the second project in the CSCI 160 course and is based on an old text based adventure game called "Camel." The object of the 
game is you have escaped pursuers with your camel and are being chased through the desert. The goal is to travel 200 miles while making 
sure neither of you go thirsty, hungry, or run out of stamina. You can rest, search for food, or happen across some water along the way. 
Everything you do will make the enemy get closer to you, unless of course you run which will slowly deplete all your resources.

I went a different route with my project, because I wanted to try my own ideas while maintaining the basic rules of the game we were 
given. I am a huge fan of the game called "Half-Life" and the basic premise is you are in an underground research facility. While working, 
your colleagues have created the very first "resonance cascade", unleashing an inter-dimensional rift that brings hordes of aggressive 
alien life-forms causing chaos everywhere. Because of this, the government gets involved and sends in special operatives who are tasked 
to "cover-up" the situation, which involves eliminating any personnel of the research facility.

This is where the game begins. You are in the depths of the research facility, and instead of having a camel, you are with a coworker. 
You and your coworker have inventories, as well as weapons. You can choose what type of character you and your coworker are (one can be 
a scientist, while the other can be a security guard, or any mix-up of the two class-types). The goal is to escape the research facility 
alive, by reaching the surface and fighting off any enemies. Instead of pursuers chasing you, radioactive materials are flooding the 
facility due to various explosions from the cascade event. So, you need to travel upwards before you die due to radioactive poison.

Things to note: 
- This game attempted a lot of things and as a result was unbalanced. It is either really easy or really difficult, depending on your
  luck.
  
- With that being said, it is not in a state that I would consider "finished." There are a *lot* of bugs that I was not able to fully 
  correct. This was my second ever attempt at writing a full program in Java, so it was really ambitious for me at the time. One of the 
  most glaring ones is the scoring system, that was a last minute feature that I was unable to implement correctly.
  
- One thing I am proud of is that I was able to implement a combat system and randomly spawning enemies that you could fight. The combat 
  was a little dynamic in that you and your coworker would have a varied amount of enemies (1-3) to fight against and you each could 
  select which enemy to attack. There were critical hit chances, as well as when you either ran out of ammo you would resort to using your 
  fists / melee weapons to fight (resulting in less damage dealt, of course).
  
- My HL_Escape project is the successor to the ideas I implemented here, and I plan on recreating what I was aiming for with this in a 
  fully GUI'd setting with more indepth mechanics (including maps that make sense).
